# Notation

We let $\group$ denote a cyclic group of prime order $p$. The identity of a
group is written as $\zero$. We refer to the scalars of elements in $\group$ as
elements in a scalar field $\field$ of size $p$. Group elements are written in
capital letters while scalars are written in lowercase or Greek letters. Vectors
of scalars or group elements are written in boldface, i.e.
$\mathbf{a} \in \field^n$ and $\mathbf{G} \in \group^n$, and are indexed from $0$.
Group operations are written additively and the multiplication of a group element
$G$ by a scalar $a$ is written $[a] G$.

We will often use the notation $\langle \mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b} \rangle$ to
describe the inner product of two same-length vectors of scalars
$\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b} \in \field^n$. We also use this notation to represent the
linear combination of group elements such as $\langle \mathbf{a}, \mathbf{G} \rangle$
with $\mathbf{a} \in \field^n, \mathbf{G} \in \group^n$, computed in practice by
a multiscalar multiplication $\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n-1} [\mathbf{a}_i] \mathbf{G}_i.$

We use $\mathbf{0}^n$ to describe a vector of length $n$ that contains only
zeroes in $\field$.
